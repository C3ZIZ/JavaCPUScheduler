# Foundation Of Operating System's Project

This project aims to simulate the ready queue in CPU scheduler. It implements various scheduling algorithms to manage the execution of processes in an operating system.

## Algorithms Implemented

- First Come First Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Job First Non-Preemptive (SJF-NP)
- Shortest Job First Preemptive (SJF-P)
- Priority
- Round Robin

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/C3ZIZ/HurryUpAndHelp.git`
4. Run the simulation by executing the Driver.java.
